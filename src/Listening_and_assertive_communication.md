## 2. Reflective Listening

**Key Points of Reflective Listening (Fisher's Model)**
Reflective listening, as explained by Fisher's model, focuses on understanding and confirming the speaker’s message. Here are the key aspects:
- **Listen and Mirror**: Pay attention to both words and emotions; mirror back what you understand to validate the speaker’s feelings.
- **Clarify and Confirm**: Ask clarifying questions to ensure no misunderstandings.
- **Encourage the Speaker**: Use body language and responses to encourage the speaker to share more.
- **Summarize Regularly**: Repeat or summarize key points to ensure mutual understanding.

Reflective listening is particularly effective in high-stakes or emotionally charged situations, helping to build trust and clarity.
