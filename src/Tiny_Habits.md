# Tiny Habits and Atomic Habits: A Reflection and Learning

## **1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg:**

### **Question 1:**
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Answer:**  
The most interesting idea in BJ Fogg's video was the concept of "Celebration" after completing a tiny habit.
He emphasizes how small, positive celebrations after even the tiniest success can help reinforce the behavior and 
create lasting change. This approach focuses on the emotional experience of completing a habit, which can serve as a 
powerful motivator. By celebrating, even if it’s as simple as a fist pump or saying "Yes!", you create positive emotions 
that increase the likelihood of repeating the habit.

## **2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message:**

### **Question 2:**
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

**Answer:**  
The **B = MAP** formula from BJ Fogg states that **Behavior (B)** is a result of three factors:
- **M (Motivation)**: The level of desire or motivation you have for doing the habit.
- **A (Ability)**: How easy or difficult the habit is to do.
- **P (Prompt)**: The trigger or cue that reminds you to do the habit.

To make a new habit easier, you can:
- **Increase Motivation**: Make the habit more appealing or rewarding.
- **Make the Habit Easier**: Reduce the difficulty, break it down into smaller steps.
- **Improve the Prompt**: Make the reminder or cue obvious and frequent (e.g., setting reminders or linking the habit 
to an existing routine).

### **Question 3:**
Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

**Answer:**  
The act of celebrating after completing a habit is crucial because it strengthens the neural connection between the
behavior and the positive emotions associated with it. This celebration, no matter how small, reinforces the habit loop 
and makes it more likely to stick over time. When you celebrate, you're effectively telling your brain that the behavior 
is worth repeating. The more you celebrate, the more your brain connects the action with positive feelings, making it a 
sustainable habit.

## **3. 1% Better Every Day Video:**

### **Question 4:**
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

**Answer:**  
The most interesting idea in this video was the concept of getting "1% better every day." The speaker talks about how 
small, consistent improvements add up over time to create exponential growth. Even though a 1% improvement each day may 
seem insignificant, over the long run, these small changes compound into massive results. This idea aligns with the 
power of habits: focusing on gradual progress instead of immediate perfection. It emphasizes consistency over intensity.

## **4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits:**

### **Question 5:**
What is the book's perspective about Identity?

**Answer:**  
In **Atomic Habits**, the author James Clear explains that identity is at the core of habit formation. Instead of 
focusing on goals, the book encourages people to focus on the type of person they want to become. The key idea is that 
your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. By identifying as the type of person who does 
the behavior you want to adopt (e.g., "I am a healthy eater" or "I am a runner"), your actions will naturally align with
that identity. This shift in mindset is a powerful tool for creating lasting change.

### **Question 6:**
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

**Answer:**  
James Clear suggests several ways to make a habit easier:
- **Make the habit obvious**: Use cues that naturally prompt the habit (e.g., placing your workout clothes next to your bed).
- **Reduce friction**: Simplify the process so that it requires less effort to complete (e.g., meal prepping or laying out your workout gear ahead of time).
- **Use habit stacking**: Pair a new habit with an already established one to create a seamless routine (e.g., after brushing your teeth, do 10 push-ups).
- **Start small**: Begin with a tiny, manageable version of the habit (e.g., reading one page instead of a chapter). This makes it easier to start, and momentum builds.

### **Question 7:**
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

**Answer:**  
To make a habit harder to do, Clear recommends increasing the friction between you and the undesired behavior. For example:
- **Make it inconvenient**: Put your phone out of reach if you're trying to reduce screen time, or hide junk food to avoid temptation.
- **Add steps to the process**: Make it more difficult to engage in a bad habit (e.g., lock your phone in a drawer to discourage mindless scrolling).
- **Change your environment**: Surround yourself with cues that support your desired habits and eliminate triggers for bad habits.

## **5. Reflection:**

### **Question 8:**
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it more obvious, attractive, easy, and/or satisfying?

**Answer:**  
**Habit**: Reading more books.

**Steps**:
- **Make it obvious**: Place a book on my desk or bedside table so it’s visible and reminds me to read.
- **Make it attractive**: Choose books that interest me or that align with my passions (e.g., personal growth or fiction I enjoy).
- **Make it easy**: Set aside 10 minutes before bed to read. Start with shorter reading sessions to build consistency.

### **Question 9:**
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it more 
invisible, unattractive, hard, or unsatisfying?

**Answer:**  
**Habit**: Excessive social media usage.

**Steps**:
- **Make it invisible**: Hide social media apps from my home screen and use screen time limits to limit access.
- **Make it unattractive**: Reflect on the negative effects of social media (e.g., wasted time or reduced productivity) and remind myself of the benefits of being offline.
- **Make it hard**: Use apps that restrict access to social media sites, or require an extra step to access them (e.g., a PIN or password).
