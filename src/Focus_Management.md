## Question 4: What Are the Dangers of Social Media?
Social media can negatively impact your focus and productivity. Some dangers include:
1. **Distraction**:
    - Constant notifications and scrolling disrupt your ability to focus deeply.
2. **Addiction**:
    - It’s designed to keep you hooked, wasting time that could be used more meaningfully.
3. **Low self-esteem**:
    - Comparing your life to others’ curated posts can make you feel inadequate.
4. **Shallow connections**:
    - Social media often replaces meaningful, face-to-face interactions.
5. **Productivity loss**:
    - Time spent on social media takes away from important or creative tasks.

To reduce these dangers, set limits on your social media usage and focus on activities that truly matter.
